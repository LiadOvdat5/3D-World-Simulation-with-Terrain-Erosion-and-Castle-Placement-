### GitHub Description: 3D World Simulation with Terrain Erosion and Castle Placement üåçüè∞

**Project Overview**  
This project serves as the culmination of our Computer Graphics course, developed using OpenGL to create an immersive 3D world. Key features include dynamic terrain erosion through simulated rain, river formation, and castle construction, all controlled via an interactive menu system.

**Features and Highlights:**
1. **Interactive Menu System:**  
   - *Start/Stop Rain Simulation* to activate or pause rainfall.  
   - *Terrain Smoothing* for a natural landscape.  
   - *Fortress Placement* algorithm finds optimal castle locations.
2. **Rain Simulation & Erosion Algorithm:**  
   - Raindrops interact dynamically with the terrain, triggering erosion and flow behavior based on proximity to rivers and landscape features.
3. **Dynamic River Creation:**  
   - Flowing raindrops carve out river paths in real-time, rendering transparent river surfaces beneath the terrain.
4. **Castle Placement and Construction:**  
   - An intelligent search algorithm ensures castle placement on flat areas near rivers and the sea.  
   - Castles feature detailed towers and walls with realistic texturing.

Developed in collaboration with Ben Vingarten.
